INVision: Inventory and Cost Management System for Building Projects

FMDC (INVision) is a desktop-based Inventory and Cost Management System
designed to organize, monitor, and automate the management of
subdivision and building projects. The system integrates project
tracking, warehouse inventory management, material cost monitoring, and
role-based access control within a secure and structured environment.
